At first glance, the two interfaces seem so completely different it was hard for me to come up with comparisons for the two. After a bit of exploration with the CLI, I began to realize that knowing one interface will help you use the other. No matter which of the two you learn first. I had never used the CLI but quickly understood the concept of how it works because I had used the GUI before. Figuring out that both of them are a way for you to command your computer to get you where you want to be within the computer system. 


One of the differences between the two I quickly noticed and the most obvious is that the GUI uses graphics and the CLI uses commands. To me, the GUI is a simpler method to utilize for the new and average computer user because it is visually intuitive and you don’t have to memorize a list of commands to navigate. Although if you know the commands for the CLI, it gives you efficient and fast actions. You can gain access to the permissions(“shields”), see what size files are, edit them, etc. with a couple of commands. Unlike the GUI where you have to navigate through many different steps to get you there. I did notice that when using the GUI you can view and manipulate multiple programs, directories, files, etc. at the same time, whereas when using the CLI I could not.  It seems that they both have their pros and cons and it’s up to you to decide which is best suited for whatever you want to do within your computer system.
