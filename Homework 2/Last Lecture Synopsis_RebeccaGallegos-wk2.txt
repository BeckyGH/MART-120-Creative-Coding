The Last Lecture was very interesting to watch. I enjoy his perspective and my biggest take away from the whole lecture was to always keep giving effort and to not lose your sense of fun and curiosity along the way. Reflecting on the notion that the mistakes we make are not failures but mere building blocks on our journey to accomplishing our dreams. I enjoyed that he used some quotes during the lecture to ponder upon. My natural love of quotes was intrigued and the one that was resonating with me the most was “Don’t bail; the best gold is at the bottom of barrels of crap”. I guess maybe because sometimes it feels easier to give up than to push through the “crap”. Throughout my life, I have had many challenges that I wasn’t sure how I would make it through. However when in the midst of each of them I had to make a decision to either stay where I was or to start searching for the courage and know-how to work through it. Like Randy said some of it is pure grit and the walls are there to be indicators of how bad we really want it. All of our efforts, our mindset, and the people we chose to surround ourselves with are the major keys to our dreams and continued growth.
