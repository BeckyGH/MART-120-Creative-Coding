The results of my Mindset quiz was 50- a strong growth mindset. I was a bit surprised that it was that high because I can recognize some of the fixed mindset characteristics within myself. However, when I was watching the videos about the growth mindset it was completely resonating with my perspective on growth, learning, and life. The focus on “not yet” instead of “I can’t or failed" and the belief that anything is possible if you want it to be. I have always tried to have an open mind philosophy to life. I agree that your mindset is key to what and how you achieve the things you want and desire in life. Keeping an open mind and curiosity to learning, in all aspects of life, I think, is critical to building the skills to get you where you want to be. Guess as I’ve gotten older and the more experience I’ve gained has taught me that it’s ok to not know things and that not knowing is where the discovery begins. Remembering to allow and apply my sense of curiosity and adventure to my schooling, I believe, will help me to expand my knowledge moving forward.
