The learning style test came out exactly how I expected. I knew that I am a visual, hands-on learner. I’ve discovered over the years that I need to see and do to retain the information better. When reading or listening I usually have to review the material many more times to understand it. The same for writing, it takes me a while to apply my thoughts to the written word. I think for this class I will utilize the videos as much as possible. I enjoyed this week’s assignments with the Dance Party and Artist Lab because it gave a visual while applying the knowledge. I’m not sure what the rest of the course is like but I have a feeling that if the videos and instruction are similar to these first two weeks I should have a great experience.
